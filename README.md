# DL_Implemenation

## Introduction
This repository showcases my work and learning progress in the AI Experience Lab course. It focuses on deep learning concepts ranging from fundamental to advanced level.

## Contents
- Perceptrons
- Loss Functions
- Backpropagation
- Optimization Techniques

#### Acknowledgments
I would like to acknowledge Professor Uehwan Kim, whose initial code and guidance were the foundation for these implementations. 
The implementations here are my adaptations of that foundational work.
